# Synapse Academy Mobile

Synapse Academy mobile (a.k.a Sydemy) is an android application which provides information about our services in Synapse Academy, which are:
- Weekend Programming Class
- Intensive Class
- Insight Workshop

Also, we have our own store which you can see in our app and the features in the app will be:
- List of our products(merchandise, accessories, stickers, etc..)
- Get information about our products by scanning QR Code
- Top-up balance by scanning QR Code

The app soon will be available in Playstore once the app is ready. For now, the application is still in development stage developed by me and the team.
